## Abstract
This project aims to create a library with open source contracts that can be used by MultiversX developers. These can be
integrated easily within any smart contract because they behave exactly as any other wasm module.


## Usage
The user manual for the xmodules can be found in the [xmodules/README.md](https://github.com/StakeGold/sc-xmodules-rs/blob/main/xmodules/README.md)


## Community
The community guidelines for contributions can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/StakeGold/sc-xmodules-rs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
