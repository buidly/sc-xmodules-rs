## About

__xModules__ are an open-source library created by builders for builders with the scope of making smart contracts building a bit more modular on MultiversX ecosystem.

Since the main SDK also provides a list of base modules that are used by the community, we felt that we can also contribute to this idea by making the community bring their components together and build a safer ecosystem.
