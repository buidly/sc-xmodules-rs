# What are xModules ?
Introduction
------------------------------------

xModules are an open-source library created by builders for builders with the scope of making smart contracts building a bit more modular on MultiversX ecosystem.

Since the main SDK also provides a list of base modules that are used by the community, we felt that we can also contribute to this idea by making the community bring their components together and build a safer ecosystem.

:bulb: The idea behind
------------------------------------

Having smart contracts modules implemented, reviewed and used by the community gives us the power to have more trust in what code we write.

We are bringing this idea of having community driven audited smart contract components and we want all of you builders out there to join us in expanding this.

Not only for us or for you but for the ecosystem in general. :rocket:
